Ooops! I thought I was submitting reshape2, but I was accidentally working on reshape :( It's not a big deal because the notes needed fixing anyway, but it does mean I changed the CITATION incorrectly. This update changes to correctly refer to reshape, not reshape2.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* License components with restrictions and base license permitting such:
  MIT + file LICENSE

## Reverse dependencies

This is a minor update to resolve outstanding R CMD check NOTEs so I did not re-check the reverse dependencies.
